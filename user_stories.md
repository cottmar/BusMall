// user stories //

edit my user stories to be a better step by step to hopefully lead me to my next move

Developer:
1. As a developer, I want to create a site that displays product images
2. Put three images in a row, with each image clickable
3. The user's favorite image will be clicked, causing a new round of images to be displayed
  3a. the images cannot be any of the previous images and cannot be the previously selected favorite
4. The number of rounds should be 25
5. After the 25th click, the number of times a picture was clicked needs to be counted
 
6. The calculated data needs to be stored


Marketer: As a markerting researcher, I want to see what users would most like to buy from a new catalogue on public transit called BusMall. I will give the developer all of the product images that I want displayed to the user to make choices from. I want the user to have a selection of three images and to choose which they'd prefer to purchase from BusMall. After the user has made their choices, I want the user to see a wrap-up of their choices displayed to them. 

Focus Group: As a focus-group member, I want to click on the prodcut image that I would most like to buy. I want to click 25 times and only have the option to click once on each round. I would also like to see what I clicked on and how many times at the end.
